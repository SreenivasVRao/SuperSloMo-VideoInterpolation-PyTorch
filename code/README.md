The Flow Computation Model is the [PWC-Net model.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02371) [(Code)](https://github.com/NVlabs/PWC-Net/tree/master/PyTorch)

You will need to install the Correlation Activations layer used by PWC-Net.
Follow the instructions [here.](https://github.com/SreenivasVRao/SuperSloMo-PyTorch/tree/master/code/SuperSloMo/external_packages/correlation-pytorch-master)

The optical flow visualization is possible using [Middlebury's Flow Code.](http://vision.middlebury.edu/flow/code/flow-code.zip) Johannes Oswald's [code](https://github.com/Johswald/flow-code-python) to read and write .flo files is also used in this project.
